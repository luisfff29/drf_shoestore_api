# Shoe Store API

Use of the Django REST framework and a fresh Django server to create an API for a shoe store with this repository: [https://github.com/luisfff29/drf_shoestore_api](https://github.com/luisfff29/drf_shoestore_api/) and display it with a React app through this repository:
[https://github.com/luisfff29/drf_shoestore_frontend](https://github.com/luisfff29/drf_shoestore_frontend/)

## Installation

Finally, you are ready to run the server with
